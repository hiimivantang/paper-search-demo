# Ralph Loop Command

Execute the setup script to initialize the Ralph loop:

🔄 Ralph loop activated in this session!

Iteration: 1
Max iterations: 1000
Completion promise: DONE (ONLY output when TRUE - do not lie!)

The stop hook is now active. When you try to exit, the SAME PROMPT will be
fed back to you. You'll see your previous work in files, creating a
self-referential loop where you iteratively improve on the same task.
